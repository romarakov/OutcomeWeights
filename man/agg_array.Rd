\title{Aggregate along an array dimension with weights}
\usage{
agg_array(a, w, dim = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{A numeric array of at least 2 dimensions.}

\item{w}{A numeric vector of weights. Its length must match the size
of the dimension being aggregated.}

\item{dim}{Integer. The dimension over which to aggregate
(default is \code{2}).}
}
\value{
A numeric array with the same dimensions as \code{a},
except with the specified dimension removed. For example, if
\code{a} is \eqn{N \times M} and \code{dim = 2}, the result is
a length-\eqn{N} vector. If \code{a} is \eqn{N \times M \times K},
the result is an \eqn{N \times K} matrix.
}
\description{
Computes the weighted sum of an array along a specified dimension.
By default, aggregates along the second dimension.
