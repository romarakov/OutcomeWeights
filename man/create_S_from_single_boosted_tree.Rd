\title{Create Smoother Matrix for a Single Boosted Tree}
\usage{
create_S_from_single_boosted_tree(
  train_leaf_ids_tree,
  test_leaf_ids_tree,
  prev_S_train,
  lambda
)
}
\arguments{
\item{train_leaf_ids_tree}{Numeric vector. Leaf indices for the training data in the tree.}

\item{test_leaf_ids_tree}{Numeric vector. Leaf indices for the test data in the tree.}

\item{prev_S_train}{Matrix or NULL. The accumulated smoother matrix from previous trees.
If NULL, this is treated as the first tree.}

\item{lambda}{Numeric. The L2 regularization parameter.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{S_train}: The smoother matrix for the training set (n_train x n_train).
\item \code{S_test}: The smoother matrix for the test set (n_test x n_train).
}
}
\description{
Computes the smoother matrix contributions for a specific boosted tree step,
applying corrections based on the previous ensemble state (\code{prev_S_train}).
